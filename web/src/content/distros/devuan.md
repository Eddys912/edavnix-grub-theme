A **Debian fork** created specifically to offer systemd-free alternatives while maintaining
compatibility with Debian packages. It uses init freedom with choices like OpenRC and sysvinit,
appealing to users who prefer traditional Unix philosophy and simpler init systems. It provides a
smooth transition for those leaving systemd-based distributions.
