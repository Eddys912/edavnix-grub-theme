A **revolutionary distribution** built on the Nix package manager with declarative system
configuration. The entire system, including kernel, drivers, and applications, is defined in a
configuration file.

Atomic updates, rollbacks, and reproducible builds make it ideal for developers and those seeking
unprecedented system reliability and consistency.
