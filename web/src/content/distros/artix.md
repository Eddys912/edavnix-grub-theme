An **Arch-based distribution** that provides systemd-free alternatives using OpenRC, runit, or s6
init systems. It maintains compatibility with Arch packages while offering users choice in
initialization systems. Ideal for those who prefer simplicity and transparency, or have
philosophical objections to systemd's complexity.
