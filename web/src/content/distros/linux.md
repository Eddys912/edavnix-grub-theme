Technically just the kernel, but commonly refers to **Unix-like operating systems** built on the
Linux kernel with GNU tools. These open-source systems power everything from smartphones and
desktops to servers and supercomputers.

The term encompasses hundreds of distributions catering to every possible use case and user
preference.
