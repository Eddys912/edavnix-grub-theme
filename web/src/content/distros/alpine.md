A **security-oriented, lightweight Linux** distribution built around musl libc and busybox. It's
designed for resource efficiency, making it perfect for containers, embedded devices, and minimal
environments.

Its small footprint (under 100MB) and simple design have made it extremely popular for
Docker images and security-conscious deployments.
