**Apple's proprietary Unix-based operating system** powering Mac computers since 2001. Built on
Darwin with a polished Aqua interface, it's known for seamless hardware integration, robust
security, and professional creative software. Its walled-garden ecosystem offers tight integration
with iOS devices, though it's restricted to Apple hardware with no official support for non-Mac
systems.
