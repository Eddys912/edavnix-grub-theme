A **community enterprise Linux** designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL. Founded by one of
CentOS's original co-founders, it fills the gap left by CentOS's shift to Stream. It provides
production-grade stability, regular security updates, and long-term support for organizations
requiring enterprise Linux without Red Hat subscriptions.
