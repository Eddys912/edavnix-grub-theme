A **oldest actively maintained Linux distribution**, known for its simplicity, stability, and
Unix-like philosophy. It deliberately avoids complex configuration tools, expecting users to
understand the system. Its conservative approach to updates and BSD-style init scripts appeal to
traditionalists who appreciate learning Linux fundamentals without automated abstractions.
