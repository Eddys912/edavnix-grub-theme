An **enterprise-class Linux distribution** derived from RHEL sources, now available as CentOS
Stream. It bridges development between Fedora and RHEL, providing rolling preview of upcoming RHEL
releases. Widely used in server environments for its stability, though its shifting model has led
many to explore alternatives like Rocky and Alma.
