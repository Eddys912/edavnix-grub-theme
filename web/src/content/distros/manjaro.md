A **user-friendly Arch-based distribution** that makes Arch accessible to newcomers through
graphical installers and pre-configured environments. It adds its own repositories and holds
packages back briefly for stability testing.

Available with multiple desktop choices including XFCE, KDE, and GNOME, it brings Arch power to a
broader audience.
