**The Amnesiac Incognito Live System** is a Debian-based distribution designed for absolute privacy
and anonymity. It forces all connections through Tor, leaves no traces on the computer, and includes
cryptographic tools.

Journalists, whistleblowers, and privacy activists rely on it for secure communication in hostile
environments.
